## Why Octopress?

Octopress describes itself as "Blogging engine for hackers".
After installing it, configuring it and deploying it. I can now say that indeed, it is.

## The path to glory is long

Octopress is for people who know wtf they are doing.

## Testing code sharing

``` javascript

    var bla = "Hello"

    $(function(){
      $("#id").click(function(){
        alert('clicked');
      });
    });

```
